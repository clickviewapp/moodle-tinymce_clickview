[![Moodle Plugin CI](https://github.com/clickviewapp/moodle-tinymce_clickview/actions/workflows/moodle-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/clickviewapp/moodle-tinymce_clickview/actions/workflows/moodle-ci.yml)

The ClickView TinyMCE editor plugin for Moodle enables you to quickly and safely browse through your entire ClickView library, the ClickView exchange and your own personal workspace from within Moodle.

This makes it easy to embed educational videos using the [TinyMCE editor](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/TinyMCE_editor) and share them with your course participants.
